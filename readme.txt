Three coordinated chartsÂ were chosen to represent different aspects of the listings:
Price distribution (to understand market pricing)
Availability vs. revenue (to identify high-performing listings)
Review scores over time (to assess guest satisfaction trends)


The layout flows from general (price distribution) to specific (performance and reviews), guiding users through an authentic exploration path.
